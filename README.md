### Experience
My work experience spans almost two decades in different industries, half of which is in software engineering and product development.

### Skills
From my leadership positions, I was described as energetic and positive, with good people and storytelling skills.

In my engineering positions, I have won mentions for being pragmatic, dedicated, thorough, and meticulous (when it comes to debugging and refactoring code).

### What I do
In truth, I am a simple person looking for simple solutions to complex problems.

I enjoy debugging, application architecture, and leading teams!
Also, I enjoy connecting with all stakeholders and being present in every part of the product development lifecycle.

And, I am just starting to contribute to open source!

I work with:
* Ruby
* Rails
* PostgreSQL (but any RDB will do)
* JavaScript (preferring vanilla, VueJS, or EmberJS)
* RubyMine, VS Code, Vim, tmux
* MacOS, Linux
* Heroku (I can do Docker and Kamal if you make me)
* Jira, Trello, and many other team and project management solutions
* Perplexity.ai, Groq, Ollama

### Interests
* Layered design in application architecture
* Patterns of application architecture with AI (modules)
* DevOps (especially IaC, Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes)
* Cybersecurity
* Solopreneurship (but I can be your Intrapreneur as well)
